## Python Installation and Setup

I installed Python 3.12.1 on my macOS machine using the official installer from python.org.  
During installation, I ran the `Install Certificates.command` as instructed.

To ensure my terminal uses the official Python instead of Anaconda, I updated my PATH by adding:

```bash
export PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin:$PATH"
